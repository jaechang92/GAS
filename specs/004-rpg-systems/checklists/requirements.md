# Specification Quality Checklist: First Level with RPG Systems

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Status

**Overall**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for planning

**Spec Quality Summary**:
- 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P6) covering full RPG system integration
- 51 functional requirements organized by system
- 10 measurable success criteria + technical constraints
- Comprehensive edge cases, assumptions, and dependencies documented
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - spec is complete and unambiguous

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement needed

## Notes

The specification successfully defines a comprehensive RPG system integration for the first playable level. All requirements are testable, measurable, and written in business language without implementation details. The feature is ready for technical planning.
